# 🔐 Cybersecurity Internship Tasks

This repository contains the 4 core tasks I completed during my internship at CodTech IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd.  
Each task demonstrates hands-on implementation of key cybersecurity concepts using Python.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 🧾 Task 1: File Integrity Checker
A SHA-256-based script that detects unauthorized changes in files by comparing saved hashes.

### 🌐 Task 2: Web Vulnerability Scanner
A GUI-based scanner built with tkinter that detects potential SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities in web forms.

### 🛠 Task 3: Penetration Testing Toolkit
Includes:
- A port scanner to identify open TCP ports
- A brute-force login tester that uses a password list on a testable form

### 🔒 Task 4: AES-256 Encryption/Decryption Tool
Encrypts and decrypts sensitive files using Python's cryptography library and Fernet (AES-based symmetric encryption).

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3.13+ is installed.
2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 cryptography
```

3. Navigate to each task folder and run the Python script:

```bash
cd Task1_FileIntegrityChecker
python file_integrity_checker.py
```

Do the same for the other tasks.
